# Pizza-Web-Project
Website which displays a pizza and provide options to add toppings on it !!!

##Steps I followed to create this code:
1) Learned the basic syntax of the html code.
2) Then, I found a way to display a picture onto the webpage.
3) Then I tried to crop the photo, which I am not able to do.
4) I added a button which enables the user to add toppings on it.
5) And, now I gave the options to add different toppings on the pizza.
